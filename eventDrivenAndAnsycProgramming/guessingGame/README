The goal of this assignment is to create a guessing game that asks the player to guess an integer between 1 and 100 chosen by the computer. The program first picks a random value using a random number generator. The player then enters her guess and submits it, and the program checks whether the guess is higher, lower, or equal to the computer's chosen number, and reports the result. The player may continue to play until she guesses the number.
